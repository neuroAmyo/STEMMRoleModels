### Where did the idea come from? 

As women in STEMM, we have all experienced the pernicious effects of misrepresentation in our fields. We've all sat in conference lecture halls eagerly learning from the speakers, but dismayed to see that none of them are women. While organizing a conference, Erin therefore aimed to have equal gender representation. Yet she quickly realized just how challenging this can be--even for the most dedicated and well-intentioned organizers. We realized that reducing the burden on conference organizers to find good women speakers could be an extremely powerful way to improve representation. While several resources exist to aggregate women in STEMM (e.g. Anne's List), these databases are field-specific, do not provide search functionality, and have limited information because they primarily rely on self-promotion or individual curation. Our idea aims to bridge these gaps, providing a mechanism for conference organizers to quickly find quality speakers for their conferences.
